## üîê Core Features Implementation

### 1. OWASP Top 10 (2021) Complete Implementation

#### A01: Broken Access Control
**Implementation Highlights:**
- Admin panel with client-side only authorization checks
- Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in tenant data access (`/api/tenants/[id]/data`)
- Horizontal privilege escalation through user ID manipulation
- Vertical privilege escalation via alternative admin endpoints
- Role-based access control bypasses through email-based detection

**Technical Details:**
- Multiple API endpoints demonstrating different access control failures
- Frontend route protection bypasses

#### A02: Cryptographic Failures
**Implementation Highlights:**
- Plaintext password storage alongside weak bcrypt hashing (3 rounds instead of 12+)
- Base64 encoding presented as encryption in client demonstrations
- JWT secrets exposed in client-side JavaScript (`window.KURUKSHETRA_CONFIG`)
- Weak encryption key management and storage patterns

**Technical Details:**
- Dual password storage system for comparison (plaintext vs. hashed)
- Client-side secret exposure through environment variables
- Weak cryptographic implementations for educational comparison

#### A03: Injection Vulnerabilities
**Implementation Highlights:**
- **SQL Injection**: Direct query construction in user search functionality
- **NoSQL Injection**: MongoDB query manipulation with JSON parsing

- **Advanced Techniques**: Union-based, boolean-based, and time-based injection

**Technical Details:**
```typescript
// Example from searchUsers function
const query = `SELECT email, username, password FROM users WHERE username LIKE '%${term}%'`;
// Intentionally vulnerable to demonstrate SQL injection
```

#### A04: Insecure Design
**Implementation Highlights:**
- Multi-step registration process with step bypass capabilities
- Client-side business logic trust in e-commerce flows
- Price manipulation in purchase systems
- Process flow assumptions allowing arbitrary progression jumps

#### A05: Security Misconfiguration
**Implementation Highlights:**
- Environment variables exposed in client-side code
- Verbose error messages revealing system information and stack traces
- Default credentials prominently displayed for training purposes
- Development features accessible in production-like environment

**Technical Details:**
```javascript
// Exposed in layout.tsx
window.KURUKSHETRA_CONFIG = {
  EXPOSED_SECRET: "FLAG{3xp0s3d_3nv_v4r_m1sc0nf1g}",
  INTERNAL_API_URL: "https://internal-api.kurukshetra.dev"
};
```

#### A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components
**Implementation Highlights:**
- Intentionally outdated package version references
- Known CVE demonstrations in component listings
- Dependency vulnerability information exposed through APIs

#### A07: Identification and Authentication Failures
**Implementation Highlights:**
- Timing attack vulnerabilities in login endpoints (75-100ms delay differences)
- Username enumeration through response timing analysis
- Weak password policies (minimum 6 characters)
- JWT token vulnerabilities with predictable secrets

#### A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures
**Implementation Highlights:**
- Client-side data validation without server-side verification
- Unsigned code update mechanisms
- Data integrity bypass scenarios in business logic flows

#### A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
**Implementation Highlights:**
- Insufficient security event logging with minimal context
- Sensitive information included in accessible log files
- No alerting for suspicious activity patterns
- Missing audit trails for critical operations

#### A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Implementation Highlights:**
- URL fetching endpoint with insufficient validation (`/api/ssrf/fetch`)
- Internal network access through SSRF exploitation
- File system access via protocol manipulation (`file://`)
- Filter bypass techniques for restricted URLs

  // Try MongoDB first (primary)
  if (mongoConnected) {
    const user = await UserModel.findOne({ email }).lean();
    if (user) return convertMongoUserToUser(user);
  }
  
  // Fallback to SQLite
